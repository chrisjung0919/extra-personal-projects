# ðŸ’» Extra Personal Projects

This repository contains a collection of small personal coding projects I created with the help of ChatGPT. These projects showcase a range of programming skills and problem-solving techniques in Python.

Each project served as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to:
- Explore different aspects of software development
- Practice writing clean, functional code
- Strengthen my understanding of logic and control structures
